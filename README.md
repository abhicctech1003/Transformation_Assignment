# Transformation_Assignment

This repository contains code for implementation of transformation used for getting output effect of translation, rotation and scaling of object in 3D space

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhicctech1003/Transformation_Assignment.git
    ```

2. **Build the Project:**

    Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or build using the command line.

3. **Run the Application:**

    Execute the built binary to run the application.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **headers**: Contains header files for triangulation, point3D, transformation & matrix class.
 
- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
 
- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.

### Source files content

- `Matrix.cpp`: Contains the calcultion for matrix creation for transformation.
- `Point.cpp`: Contains the calcultion point in 3D space.
- `Point3D.cpp`: Contains the getter and setter for coordinates.
- `Shape.cpp`: Contains the constructor 7 destructor.
- `STLreader.cpp`: Contains the Stl file data reading code.
- `STLWriter.cpp`: Contains the Stl file data writing code.
- `Transform.cpp`: Contains the calcultion for translation, rotation & scale transformation.
- `Triangle.cpp`: Contains the calcultion to get vertices of triangle.
- `Triangulation.cpp`: Contains the calcultion for triangulation.
- `VertexValue.cpp`: Contains the calcultion for getting center.
